# Fleet

Welcome to a set of examples on how to deploy and customize Rancher addons via fleet to AKS.

The examples are based on Martin Weiss' excellent [repository](https://github.com/Martin-Weiss/rancher-fleet) and are tailored to an imported [AKS cluster](https://github.com/chfrank-cgn/Rancher/tree/master/aks-cluster).

You can find detailed explanations and instructions for all Terraform plans on my [Wiki](https://chfrank-cgn.github.io/)

Happy Ranching!
